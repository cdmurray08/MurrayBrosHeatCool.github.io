        Electronics Club is easy to join, not to mention free. Subscribe to our mailing list (top right corner of the page) and attend our next meeting. If you would like to rent tools, take components for projects, or work on projects in the club room, attend our office hours. Members who are interested are encouraged to take on a leadership role, granting 24/7 lab room access.
